### Hi there, it's Suzukihonoka~ 👋   
My friends often call me **Starx** in the workarounds.  
# IMAGINATIN
I'am very keen on discovery the high-tech new things.  
And I also love **ANIME, ACG SONGS, etc**.  
But I'm not so **open** in the **real world**.  
So it's good to know you in the **internet**.  
Let's keep the friendships forever! ❤ 

# PROGRAMMING SKILLS
I self studied some programming languages and still working on some of it.  
I usually write the **backends**.  
I might study some **frontend** basic in the future.
